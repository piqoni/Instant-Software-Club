# Instant Software Club: Promoting Fast Software

Despite amazing hardware advances, software continues to be [slow](https://tonsky.me/blog/disenchantment/). It is somehow acceptable for software to be slow and still widely used (Jira Next-Gen comes to mind). [We dont want fast software to become a lost art](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pW-SOdj4Kkk). 

Instant Software Club is committed to curate and promote software that is instant and high-performant. We believe that fast software is essential for providing a seamless and enjoyable user experience, and we will promote products that meet this standard.

Rules for a product to enter the Club:

1. Performance is a top priority: All software accepted into the club must prioritize performance and strive for instant responsiveness.

2. Minimize feature creep: Software should focus on delivering a core set of features that are essential for the user, rather than trying to include every possible feature.

3. Simplicity is key: Fast software should be intuitive and easy to use, with a clear and straightforward interface.
